# Clustering Methods
## KMeans Clustering
- Groups by: Distsance
- Shows: Spherical Clusters

- K is the number of clusters used for the algorithm
- Clusters are nonoveralpping; no point belongs to more than one cluster
- Within cluster variation should be as small as possible for all clusters
- Within cluster variation is measured using many techniques, most popular is the Euclidean distance
- Two most popular methods to find optimal value of K are; Elbow method and Silhouette Method

## DBSCAN
- Groups by: Density
- Shows: Outliers, Variable Shapes
## Hierarchical 
- Groups by: Similarity
